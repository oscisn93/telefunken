[Telefunken](https://www.coololdgames.com/card-games/rummy/contract/telefunken) is a Rummy-like card game popular in South America. The goal, like in most Rummy games, is to be the first to empty the cards from your hand by forming sets and sequences in accordance with the current contract. When a player wins a round or deal the remaining players get penalty points equivalent to the total value of the cards in their hand. At the end of 7 deals, the player with theleast penalty points wins!
